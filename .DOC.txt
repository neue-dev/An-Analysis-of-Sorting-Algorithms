Here are all the resources I consulted for implementing the algorithms and doing the testing :))

Note that I was initially considering to implement merge sort with no aux space (and thus the reference above),
but I found a way to simplify the implementation without having to do this. Removing the aux space needed by the
algorithm would increase its time complexity to at least O(n(logn)^2), which I didn't want.
