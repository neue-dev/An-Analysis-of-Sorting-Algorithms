# An Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

This is a project done in accordance with the specifications of CCDSALG1.

# Introduction

This repository currently only features a few select sorting algorithms. They are:

1. Insertion Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Heap Sort
5. Smooth Sort

Hopefully more will come. In hindsight Smooth Sort was the most difficult to implement, but it was fun nonetheless.
